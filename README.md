# ü§ñ Supervised Machine Learning Projects

**Author**: Cristian Murillo 

A collection of supervised machine learning projects applying classification and regression techniques across diverse real-world datasets.

This repository serves as a practical record of experimentation with traditional ML pipelines using scikit-learn. Each project is self-contained and includes data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and interpretation.

## üìÅ Project Overview

### 1. üß™ Wine Quality Classification

- **Dataset**: UCI Wine Quality Dataset
- **Goal**: Predict wine quality (low, medium, high) based on physicochemical attributes
- **Techniques**:
  - Multiclass classification
  - Stratified train-test split
  - Logistic Regression, DecisionTreeClassificer, Random Forest Classifier, XGBClassifier, MLPClassifier comparison.
  - RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
  - Class imbalance handling

### 2. ü§ü Sign Language MNIST Classification

- **Dataset**: [Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist)
- **Goal**: Classify hand signs (A‚ÄìY) from 28x28 grayscale images
- **Techniques**:
  - **PCA** for dimensionality reduction
  - **KNN Classifier** as final model
  - Model selection via **GridSearchCV**
  - Confusion matrix to evaluate per-class performance
- **Notes**: PCA reduces dimensionality but may impact image fidelity and model accuracy

- **Dataset**: [Cerebral Stroke Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/cerebral-stroke-predictionimbalaced-dataset)
- **Goal**: Predict whether a patient is likely to experience a stroke
- **Techniques**:
  - Preprocessing pipeline with imputation, scaling, and encoding
  - Handling class imbalance
  - Evaluation using confusion matrix and precision-recall tradeoff
