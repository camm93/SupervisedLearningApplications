# Cerebral Stroke Prediction-Imbalanced Dataset

From [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/cerebral-stroke-predictionimbalaced-dataset)

**Context**

A stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident or CVA is when part of the brain loses its blood supply and the part of the body that the blood-deprived brain cells control stops working. This loss of blood supply can be ischemic because of lack of blood flow, or hemorrhagic because of bleeding into brain tissue. A stroke is a medical emergency because strokes can lead to death or permanent disability. There are opportunities to treat ischemic strokes but that treatment needs to be started in the first few hours after the signs of a stroke begin.

**GOAL**

Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a tool for early CVA detection.
